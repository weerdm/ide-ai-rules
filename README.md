# 📏 Frontend Development Rules

<div align="center">
  <p><em>Standardized rules for consistent, high-quality frontend development</em></p>
</div>

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains standardized rules to improve code generation and maintain consistency across Trengo repositories. These rules help teams follow best practices and reduce errors when developing with modern tooling and AI assistance.

> This repository also provides rules formatted for Cursor, allowing teams using Cursor to benefit from the same standards in an automated way. See [rules/cursor/README.md](./rules/cursor/README.md) for details.
