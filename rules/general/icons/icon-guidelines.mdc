# Icon Guidelines

## Icon Structure

- Icons should be implemented as Vue components
- Icons should be SVG-based for scalability
- Each icon should be placed in the appropriate category directory:
  - `filled/` for filled icons
  - `linear/` for outlined/linear icons
  - `logos/` for logo icons
- Use the appropriate mixin for each icon type:
  - `icon-mixin.ts` for regular icons
  - `logos-mixin.ts` for logo icons

## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for icon component names
- Include the style as a suffix (e.g., `UserFill`, `ArrowTopRightLinear`)
- Be descriptive but concise with icon names
- Group related icons together with consistent naming

## SVG Optimization

- Optimize SVGs before adding them to the library
- Remove unnecessary attributes and metadata
- Use consistent viewBox dimensions
- Ensure icons can be styled with CSS (fill, stroke, etc.)

## Implementation

- Keep icons simple and focused
- Icons should scale well at different sizes
- Avoid complex gradients or effects that may not render well
- Icons should have good contrast at all sizes

## Export Format

- Export icons as Vue components
- Include TypeScript types for all exports
- Use named exports for icons
- Group exports logically in index files

## Documentation

- Document each icon with a clear name and description
- Showcase icons in a catalog or storybook
- Include examples of common use cases
- Document any special considerations for specific icons
