# Design System Guidelines

## Design Tokens

- Use the project's design tokens for colors, spacing, typography, etc.
- Avoid hardcoding values that should come from the design system
- Use CSS variables for dynamic values
- Maintain consistency across components

## Colors

- Use Tailwind color classes
- Follow the color palette defined in the design system
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility
- Use semantic color variables (e.g., `primary`, `danger`) instead of direct color values

## Typography

- Use the typography scale defined in the design system
- Use appropriate heading levels (h1-h6)
- Maintain consistent text styles across components
- Consider text overflow and truncation

## Spacing

- Use the spacing scale defined in the design system
- Maintain consistent spacing between elements
- Use appropriate margins and padding
- Consider responsive spacing for different screen sizes

## Icons

- Use the trengo-icons library for all icons
- Follow the naming convention for icons (e.g., `UserFill`, `ArrowTopRightLinear`)
- Use appropriate icon sizes based on context
- Ensure icons are accessible with proper aria-labels

## Component Variants

- Create reusable variants for components (e.g., primary, secondary, danger)
- Document variants in Storybook
- Use consistent props for variants across components
- Allow customization while maintaining design consistency

## Responsive Design

- Design components to work across all screen sizes
- Use responsive props where appropriate
- Test components at different viewport sizes
- Consider touch targets for mobile devices
